# Special-purpose script for converting the NCBI taxonomy data dump
# into the brat normalization DB input format
# (http://brat.nlplab.org/normalization.html).

# The script expects as input the names.dmp file available from
# the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/).
# As of late 2012, the following commands could be used to get
# this file (and a number of other related ones):
#
#     wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz
#     tar xvzf taxdump.tar.gz

# The names.dmp contains four fields per line, separated by pipe
# characters ("|"): tax_id, name_txt, unique name, and name class.
# This script discards the "unique name" field (which has values such
# as "Drosophila <fruit fly, genus>"), groups the others by tax_id,
# and filters likely irrelevance names by name class.

# Note that this script is not optimized in any way takes some minutes
# to run on the full NCBI taxonomy data.
