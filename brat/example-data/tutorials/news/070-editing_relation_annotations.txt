Editing relation annotations

Relation annotations can be modified or deleted similarly to text span annotations, using the Edit Annotation dialog that is shown when double-clicking on the relation type.

To try this out: first, delete the extra relation annotations in the following sentences:


1 ) Terry Pratchett has no particular association with Yokohama.

2 ) Terry Pratchett and J. K. Rowling are certainly not the same person.


In the Edit Annotation dialog for relations, "Reselect" is similar to "Move" for spans. Try using this function to correct the annotation in the next sentence.


3) Terry Pratchett lives in Buckinghamshire, which is near Oxfordshire.


Relation annotation types can also be changed similarly to text span annotation types.


4) Terry Pratchett lives in Buckinghamshire.


Easy, isn't it?




Hints

* As in the Edit Annotation dialog for text span annotations, DEL and INS can also be used for deleting and re-selecting in the edit dialog for relation annotations.
