Welcome to the Brat Rapid Annotation Tool (brat) tutorial!

brat is a web-based tool for structured text annotation and visualization. The easiest way to explain what this means is by example: see the following sentence illustrating various types of annotation. Take a moment to study this example, moving your mouse cursor over some of the annotations. Hold the cursor still over an annotation for more detail.


1 ) Citibank was involved in moving about $100 million for Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of a former Mexican president, to banks in Switzerland.


If this example seems complicated, don't panic! This tutorial will present the key features of brat interactively, with each document presenting one or a few features. If you follow this brief tutorial, you'll be able to understand and create annotations such as those above in no time.
