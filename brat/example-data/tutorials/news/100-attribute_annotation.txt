Attribute annotation

To support the annotation of properties in more detail than just annotation type, brat supports ATTRIBUTE ANNOTATION. Attributes are either binary (on/off) flags or values selected from a set of possible alternatives.

Some examples are shown in the following. Take a moment to study these by hovering over the annotations with the mouse cursor to see the information display, and then double-click to open the Edit Annotation dialog to see how the attributes are set.


1 ) Somebody twitted that YouTube may merge with Google.

3 ) A merger between YouTube and Google.

4 ) CNN reports that YouTube has merged with Google.


As you may have noted earlier, there are separate controls under the annotation type selector for attributes. Try using these now to make the attribute settings for the following annotations match those above.


1 ) Somebody twitted that YouTube may merge with Google.

3 ) A merger between YouTube and Google.

4 ) CNN reports that YouTube has merged with Google.


Attributes can be set when creating a new annotation in exactly the same way that they can be set when editing an existing one.
