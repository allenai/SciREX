Annotation notes

Although brat is primarily oriented toward structured annotation that can be automatically interpreted, it also supports free-text NOTES that can be attached to annotations. Annotations with notes are emphasized with a visual highlight, and notes can be read either by hovering the mouse cursor over the annotation or by opening the Edit Annotation dialog. Some examples are shown below.


1 ) We study IgG.

2 ) IL-10 binds IL-10R1 and IL-10R2.

3 ) NF-kappa B c-Rel subunit.


Try out this functionality by adding some notes below.

Notes can be useful for communicating between annotators collaborating on a single project or for leaving yourself reminders. However, to make automatic processing of your annotations easier, it's recommended to use explicitly structured annotation whenever possible!
