Editing relation annotations

Relation annotations can be modified or deleted similarly to text span annotations, using the Edit Annotation dialog that is shown when double-clicking on the relation type.

To try this out: first, delete the extra relation annotations in the following sentences:


1 ) p53 is not a part of the protein complex NF-kappa B.

2 ) Aspirin, paracetamol and morphine are all analgesic, but not the same thing.


In the Edit Annotation dialog for relations, "Reselect" is similar to "Move" for spans. Try using this function to correct the annotation in the next sentence.


3) c-Rel is a component of NF-kappa B but not of IkB kinase.


Relation annotation types can also be changed similarly to text span annotation types.


4) c-Rel is a component of NF-kappa B.


Easy, isn't it?




Hints

* As in the Edit Annotation dialog for text span annotations, DEL and INS can also be used for deleting and re-selecting in the edit dialog for relation annotations.
