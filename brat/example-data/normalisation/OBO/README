Example normalization reference resources extracted from ontologies
from the OBO Foundry (http://www.obofoundry.org).

NOTE: to reduce the size of this data, only subsets of some of the
larger reference resources have been extracted, as follows:

- Gene Ontology (GO.txt): terms from the three roots of GO
  (molecular_function, biological_process, cellular_component) up to
  depth 4.

- Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA.txt): terms from the FMA root
  up to depth 7.
