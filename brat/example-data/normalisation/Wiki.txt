The Cowboys' streak of 160 sold-out regular and post-season games began in 1990, and included 79 straight sellouts at their home, Texas Stadium, and 81 straight sell-outs on the road.     An article from Forbes Magazine, dated September 10, 2008, lists the Cowboys as the most valuable football franchise in the world, with an estimated value of approximately $1.612 billion, ahead of the Washington Redskins ($1.538 billion) and the New England Patriots ($1.324 billion). They are also one of the wealthiest teams in the NFL, generating almost $269 million in annual revenue.     The Cowboys have been one of the most successful teams of the modern era (since 1960). The team has won five Super Bowls and eight Conference Championships. The Cowboys have more victories (41) on Monday Night Football than any other NFL team; the Miami Dolphins are second with 39 and the San Francisco 49ers are third with 38. They hold NFL records for the most consecutive winning seasons (20, from 1966 to 1985) and most seasons with at least ten wins (25). The team has earned the most post-season appearances (29, which includes another league record of 56 post-season games, winning 32 of them), the most division titles with 19, the most appearances in the NFC Championship Game (14), and the most Super Bowl appearances (8), two more than any other NFL team. The Cowboys also played in two NFL championship games before the NFL's 1970 merger with the American Football League. The Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in just four years (a feat that has been matched only once since, by the New England Patriots). They are also tied with the San Francisco 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers for having the most Super Bowl wins (5). The Cowboys' success and popularity has earned them the nickname "America's Team". In a statistical comparison of all teams since the AFL-NFL merger, ESPN's Page 2 placed the Cowboys at the top of its Ultimate Power Ranking.	info:<IMG>:http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/image_thumb/m/02kzx1t	attr:Type:Sports Team	info:Info:The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football franchise that plays in the Eastern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL).

Much of Dylan's most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when he became an informal chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of American unrest. A number of his songs, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" became anthems of the civil rights movements. His most recent studio album, Modern Times, released on August 29, 2006, entered the U.S. album chart at number one, and that same year was named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone magazine.Dylan's early lyrics incorporated political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to thecounterculture. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, he has explored many traditions of American song, from folk, blues and country to gospel,rock and roll and rockabilly to English, Scottish and Irish folk music, and even jazz and swing. Dylan performs with the guitar, piano and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the "Never Ending Tour". Although his accomplishments as performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally regarded as his greatest contribution.	info:<IMG>:http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/image_thumb/m/04pxcqr	attr:Type:Person	info:Info:Bob Dylan, born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941, is an American singer-songwriter, musician, poet, and painter.

10707	name:Name:Fiji	info:Description:An island nation in the South Pacific Ocean east of Vanuatu, west of Tonga and south of Tuvalu. The country occupies an archipelago of about 322 islands, of which 106 are permanently inhabited, and 522 islets. The two major islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, account for 87% of the population. The first people of Fiji arrived long before contact with European explorers in the seventeenth century. Pottery excavated from Fijian towns shows that Fiji was settled before or around 1000BC, although the question of Pacific migration still lingers.The Dutch explorer Abel Tasman visited Fiji in 1643 while looking for the Great Southern Continent. It was not until the nineteenth century, however, that Europeans settled the islands permanently.The islands came under British control as a colony in 1874, and the British brought over Indian contract labourers. It was granted independence in 1970. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 because the government was perceived as dominated by the Indo-Fijian (Indian) community. The second 1987 coup saw the British monarchy and the Governor General replaced by a non-executive President, and the country changed the long form of its name from Dominion of Fiji to Republic of Fiji (and to Republic of the Fiji Islands in 1997). The coups and accompanying civil unrest contributed to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that Melanesians became the majority.	info:<IMG>:http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/image_thumb/m/059hzxn	attr:Type:Location	info:Info:Fiji , officially the Republic of Fiji , is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island.

22620057	name:Name:1948 Palestinian exodus	name:Name:1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle	name:Also known as:Exodus from Lydda	info:Description:The 1948 Palestinian exodus, occurred when approximately 725,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the Civil War that preceded it.\r\nNur-eldeen Masalha writes that over 80 percent of the Arab inhabitants of the area that became Israel left their towns and villages. Jewish advances, such as that on Haifa, fears of a massacre after Deir Yassin, and a collapse in Palestinian leadership caused many to leave out of panic, while some of those who remained were expelled by Jewish soldiers or, later, the Israeli government. A series of laws passed by the first Israeli government prevented them from returning to their homes, or claiming their property. They and many of their descendants remain refugees.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1949 Lausanne conference, Israel proposed allowing 100,000 of the refugees to return to the area, though not necessarily to their homes, including 25,000 who had returned surreptitiously and 10,000 family-reunion cases. The proposal was conditional on a peace treaty that would allow Israel to retain the territory it had taken, and on the Arab states absorbing the remaining 550,000–650,000 refugees. The Arab states rejected the proposal on both moral and political grounds.\r\n\r\nThe status of the refugees, and in particular whether they have a right to return to their homes or be compensated, are key issues in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The events of 1948 are commemorated by Palestinians every May 15, on what has become known as Nakba Day.	attr:Type:Event	info:Info:The 1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle was the flight or expulsion of 50,000–70,000 Palestinian Arabs when Israel troops captured the towns in July that year.

1067305	name:Name:Ronald Ryan	info:<IMG>:http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/image_thumb/m/02bm658	info:Description:Ronald Joseph Ryan was born at Royal Women's Hospital in Carlton, Victoria to John and Cecilia (nee Young) Ryan. His childhood was marked by dire poverty including his parents unemployment due to illness, alcoholism and neglect. At an early age, Ryan and his three younger sisters were bought to the attention of the state welfare authorities who declared them as neglected children. They were made wards of the state and sent to orphanages.\r\n\r\nRyan was a gambler and had been a petty-criminal with no police record of violence. His criminal record did not begin until he was 31 years of age. On December 19, 1965 while serving prison time for robbery at Pentridge Prison, Ryan and fellow prisoner Peter Walker planned a daring prison escape, which was to go horribly wrong. They climbed a prison wall with the aid of wooden benches, bed sheets and iron hooks. Ryan seiged a rifle from prison officer Helmut Lange and escaped to freedom down the prison tower staircase. Amongst scenes of noise and confusion a single shot was heard and prison officer George Hodson fell dead on the road. A prison officer admitted he fired a single shot in the direction of Ryan, Walker and Hodson.\r\n \r\nRyan and Walker were on the run for nineteen days and recaptured in Sydney. They were eventually caught with the help of a friend who unknown to the escapees had turned to a police informant. The escapees were extradited to Melbourne where Ryan was charged with the shooting death of Hodson. Ryan had intentionally kept the rifle he stole from prison officer Lange, as he knew that in the event of recapture, scientific tests would prove his didn't fire a shot at all. However, police officers had hidden Ryan's rifle in the boot of a police car where it was subjected to dirt and dust.\r\n\r\nThe trial began on March 15, 1966. Despite a total lack of scientific ballistic forensic evidence, mysterious missing pieces of vital evidence that would have cleared Ryan, serious ambiguities in the case, dire widespread inconsistencies of all fourteen eyewitnesses’ evidence for the prosecution, and testimony by a prison officer that he fired the one single shot (the one and only shot heard by all persons), and the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, which Ryan could not have fired in such a manner, Ryan was convicted of the shooting death of a prison officer Hodson based solely on unrecorded unsigned unproven allegations of verbals/confessions, said to have been made by Ryan to police. Ryan always denied making any verbals nor confessions to any person and only signed documents stating that he would not be saying anything until he consulted an attorney.

J. Abrams, written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and produced by Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk. It is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise that was created by Gene Roddenberry and features the main characters of the original Star Trek series, who are portrayed by a new cast. With one original cast member appearing in the film (Leonard Nimoy) as Spock prime.  It explores the back stories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) , Spock (Zachary Quinto), and Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban) before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The film was released in conventional theaters and some IMAX theaters on May 8, 2009, following a limited number of advanced screenings starting at 7pm the night before. Star Trek screenings grossed an Imax record of $8.5 million during the film's first weekend. Development of the film began in 2005 when Paramount Pictures contacted Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman for ideas to revive the franchise. The creative team contrasted Orci and Lindelof, who consider themselves "Trekkies", with casual fans like Abrams, who all aimed to create a film that would interest a general audience. The film payed tribute to original Cannon by featuring several cliché one liners by the new actors that were a staple of the original franchise. Paramount pushed back the release of the film from Dec. 25 to May 8, 2009, saying the picture's gross potential is greater as a summer film. Elements of the writer's favorite novels were included, and modified continuity with the time-travel storyline, a modernized bridge along with the production design of the original show. Filming took place from November 2007 to March 2008 under intense secrecy.	info:<IMG>:http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/image_thumb/m/0g9dd2t	attr:Type:Film	info:Info:Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction film directed by J.

He ruled from 1894 until his forced abdication in 1917. Nicholas proved unable to manage a country in political turmoil and command its army in World War I. His rule ended with the Russian Revolution of 1917, after which he and his family were shot by Bolsheviks. Nicholas's full name was Nikolay Aleksandrovich Romanov (Никола́й Алекса́ндрович Рома́нов). His official title was Nicholas II, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias. He is sometimes referred to as Nicholas the Martyr due to his execution and as Bloody Nicholas because of the tragic events during his coronation and his government's subsequent suppression of dissent. As a result of his canonization, he has been regarded as Saint Nicholas The Passion Bearer by the Russian OrthodoxNicholas was determined to uphold authority yet lacked assertiveness. He was Obstinate, ineffectual, easily influenced. He had genuine affection for the people but expected them to be blindly obedient. He was as a ‘little man lost in the immensity of his realm’ The Reign of Nicholas up to 1905  He has a bad start to his regime. In 1895 Members of the Tver Zemstvo requested opportunity to express opinions to the government; Nicholas rejected them as ‘senseless dreams’. The Celebrations at his coronation contained free beer stampede, 1300 dead. Nicholas II carried on celebrations by attending a French Ball, visiting hospitals next day. This did great damage as he was seen as uncaring, reinforced on Bloody Sunday (1905) Reform requests were rejected by Nicholas. University unrest grew, 1899 student protests suppressed and universities were closed. Many students joined the SRs who increased assassinations, e.g. Interior Minister (Plehve). Russification continued. The unrest in the Countryside grew as with land hunger plus SR propaganda. Towns’ unrest e.g. 1896 St. Petersburg strike, Led Zubatov (Moscow Okhrana chief) to set up a union to monitor unrest. However it failed as it became involved in General Strike in Odessa in 1903 and Zubatov was  dismissed. Father Gapon was allowed to set up ‘The Assembly of Russian Factory Workers’ to channel unrest however it Backfired and led to Bloody Sunday involvement.

The recognition and understanding of mental health conditions have changed over time and across cultures, and there are still variations in the definition, assessment, and classification of mental disorders, although standard guideline criteria are widely accepted. A few mental disorders are diagnosed based on the harm to others, regardless of the subject's perception of distress. Over a third of people in most countries report meeting criteria for the major categories at some point in their lives. The causes are often explained in terms of a diathesis-stress model or biopsychosocial model. In biological psychiatry, mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience.	attr:Type:Literature Subject	info:Info:A mental disorder or mental illness is a psychological or behavioral pattern that is generally associated with distress or disability, and which is not considered part of normal development or a person's culture.

The capital and largest city is Charleston.  Historically the area now occupying West Virginia had a separate identity from the early days of pioneering settlement. The early British American settlers called the area Vandalia. After the American Revolution the settlers of the area sought the status of an individual state of the union under the name Westsylvania, but their attempts were blocked by Virginia which claimed most of the area, and Pennsylvania which claimed a small part of the area.  After the Wheeling Conventions, West Virginia broke away from Virginia during the American Civil War and was admitted to the Union as a separate state on June 20, 1863, and was a key Civil War border state. It is one of only two states formed during the American Civil War (along with Nevada, which separated from Utah Territory) and is the only state to form by seceding from a Confederate state and one of three states to secede from another state (the others being Kentucky and Maine).  The Census Bureau considers West Virginia part of the South because most of the state is south of the Mason-Dixon Line. The northern panhandle, however, extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio with the West Virginia city of Weirton on a parallel with Pittsburgh, while Bluefield is less than seventy miles from North Carolina and Harper's Ferry is considered to be a part of the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The unique position of West Virginia means that it is often included in a wide variety of geographical regions, including the Southeastern United States and even the Northeastern United States. Notably, it is the only state which entirely lies within the area served by the Appalachian Regional Commission, which is a common definition of Appalachia.[4]  The state is noted for its great natural beauty, its historically significant logging and coal mining industries, and its labor history. It is also known for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities, including skiing, whitewater rafting, rock climbing, caving, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, and hunting.	attr:Type:Location	info:Info:West Virginia is a state in the Appalachia and Southeastern regions of the United States, bordered by Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Ohio to the northwest, Pennsylvania to the northeast and Maryland to the east.

Major events during his presidency include the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the building of the Berlin Wall, the Space Race, the American Civil Rights Movement and early events of the Vietnam War.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas, United States. Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, but was himself murdered two days later by Jack Ruby before Oswald could be put on trial. The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald had acted alone in killing the president. However, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in 1979 that there may have been a conspiracy. For the public at large, the entire subject remains controversial and shrouded in mystery with multiple allegation theories. The assassination itself proved to be a defining moment in U.S. History due to its traumatic impact on the psyche\nof the nation and its ensuing political fallout; a historical fallout\nthat influenced, and continues to influence, the temperament of\nAmerican society. President Kennedy is now regarded as an icon of\nAmerican hopes and aspirations to every new generation of Americans.	info:<IMG>:http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/image_thumb/m/021l_vn	attr:Type:Person	info:Info:John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK, was the 35th President of the United States, serving from 1961 until his assassination in 1963.

15295	name:Name:Intelligent Design	info:Description:Intelligent Design The theory of intelligent design (ID) holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause rather than an undirected process such as natural selection. ID is thus a scientific disagreement with the core claim of evolutionary theory that the apparent design of living systems is an illusion.In a broader sense, Intelligent Design is simply the science of design detection -- how to recognize patterns arranged by an intelligent cause for a purpose. Design detection is used in a number of scientific fields, including anthropology, forensic sciences that seek to explain the cause of events such as a death or fire, cryptanalysis and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). An inference that certain biological information may be the product of an intelligent cause can be tested or evaluated in the same manner as scientists daily test for design in other sciences.ID is controversial because of the implications of its evidence, rather than the significant weight of its evidence. ID proponents believe science should be conducted objectively, without regard to the implications of its findings. This is particularly necessary in origins science because of its historical (and thus very subjective) nature, and because it is a science that unavoidably impacts religion.

After losing a power struggle with the board of directors in 1985, Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher education and business markets. NeXT's subsequent 1997 buyout by Apple Computer Inc. brought Jobs back to the company he co-founded, and he has served as its CEO since then. Steve Jobs was listed as Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Businessman of 2007. In 1986, he acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm Ltd which was spun off as Pixar Animation Studios. He remained CEO and majority shareholder until its acquisition by the Walt Disney Company in 2006. Jobs is currently the Walt Disney Company's largest individual shareholder and a member of its Board of Directors. He is considered a leading figure in both the computer and entertainment industries. Jobs's history in business has contributed greatly to the myths of the quirky, individualistic Silicon Valley entrepreneur, emphasizing the importance of design while understanding the crucial role aesthetics play in public appeal. His work driving forward the development of products that are both functional and elegant has earned him a devoted following. 	attr:Type:Person	info:Info:Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman and inventor widely recognized as a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer revolution.

Other members in the original line up from 1991 were Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group in 1991 although he later appeared in the film clip for Dorothy the Dinosaur which was filmed around March of 1992. He was still a member of the Partnership until late 1992.Greg Page later left the group as lead singer due to illness and was replaced by Sam Moran..Accounts about the group's formation vary. Some say the eponymous debut album of 1991 was a project for their studiues at Macquarie University although this is not likely since Anhtony Field and Murray Cook were Third Year students at the time and Greg Page was in First Year. Wilcher was actually a member of staff at Macquarie assisting in the Early Childhood Music program. Fatt was not a member of the student body.

38214	name:Name:The Illuminatus! Trilogy	info:Description:The Illuminatus! Trilogy is a series of three novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson primarily between 1969 and 1971. The trilogy is a satirical, postmodern, science fiction-influenced adventure story; a drug-, sex- and magic-laden trek through a number of conspiracy theories, both historical and imaginary, which hinge around the authors' version of the Illuminati. The narrative often switches between third and first person perspectives and jumps around in time. It is thematically dense, covering topics like counterculture, numerology and Discordianism.The trilogy comprises the books The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple and Leviathan. They were first published starting in September 1975, as three separate volumes, and in 1984 as an omnibus; they are now more commonly reprinted in the latter form. The trilogy won the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award, designed to honor classic libertarian fiction, in 1986. The authors went on to create several works, both fiction and nonfiction, that further discussed the themes of the trilogy, but no direct sequels were produced. Illuminatus! has been adapted for the stage, and has influenced several modern writers, musicians and games-makers. The popularity of the word "fnord" and the 23 enigma can both be attributed to the trilogy. It remains a seminal work of conspiracy fiction, predating Foucault's Pendulum and The Da Vinci Code by decades.	attr:Type:Literary Series	info:Info:The Illuminatus!

George Fox (1624-1691), an English\npreacher, founded the Society of Friends, whose open structure reflects\nhis aversion to church hierarchy and titles. Fox held that the “Inner\nLight,” the inspiring presence of God in each person, stands above\nScripture and creed. This belief resonates through Quakerism despite a\nfairly wide variety of practices.Quaker beliefs include the emphasis on plain speech and dress;\nopposition to slavery and war; and the refusal to swear oaths, which\nQuakers believe undermine the daily mandate for truth-telling. Many\nearly feminists and abolitionists were Quakers, and a strong social\nethic continues to pervade the work of the American Friends Service\nCommittee, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947.\nQuakers, who often met persecution for their beliefs, have also been\nchampions of religious freedom. English Quaker William Penn founded\nPennsylvania as a "holy experiment," a refuge for Quakers and other\nreligious minorities. Quaker congregations are called "meetings," which range from structured\nservices led by ministers to open sessions where participants speak\nwhen inspired by their own Inner Light. Major Quaker umbrella\norganizations are the Friends General Conference of Philadelphia and\nFriends United Meeting, based in Richmond, Indiana, and Evangelical Friends International in Ohio.	info:<IMG>:http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/image_thumb/m/022p_m2	attr:Type:Religion	info:Info:The Religious Society of Friends, or Friends Church, is a Christian movement which stresses the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.

The Boston police, tipped off to go for the second time to the Harvard Medical College, also found there a torso in a large tea chest. It was just one week after the teaching facilitys largest patron had vanished. The conclusion law enforcement reached seemed obvious. The absent gentleman had met his demise in this building, then was butchered and disposed of in an attempt to hide the crime. For the next nine months, Boston, New York and the rest of the world were transfixed by the unfolding drama of investigation, trial, conviction, and execution. The missing pillar of Boston society and slum landlord had been seen on the granite steps of the medical institute. After missteps and the pursuit of more than one red herring, his murderer was identified as the master of the chemistry lab and himself a member of Bostons upper crust. This genial professor was struggling to support a life-style grander than his salary. Worse, he had borrowed from the missing man and the notes were said to be past due. Motive seemed clear and a jury found the Harvard donblindsided, then framed, aided by a flawed justice systemguilty. In a public ceremony attended by thousands, he was hanged although his last-minute confession in anothers hand was no more persuasive than the judges charge that the jury embrace witnesses who saw the victim in the morning of the day he went missing, yet disregard the group who spotted him in the afternoon. On that last day of his life, the walks hed taken for decades would end in tragedy both for him and the man to be strung up on the gallowsas the out-for-blood press picked up the pace and a scandalized social order stepped asideboth overlooking a sly tipster in the shadows.
