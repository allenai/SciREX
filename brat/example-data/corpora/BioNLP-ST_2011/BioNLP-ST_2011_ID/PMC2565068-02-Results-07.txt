scpC and slo are insufficient singly for the pathogenesis of invasive infections 
Finally, we assessed the influence of enhanced expression of the scpC or the slo gene on the virulence in a mouse model. As shown in Table 1, NIH230scpC and NIH230slo exerted the LD50 value 3-10 fold lower than that of the non-invasive isolate 1566, but 10-30 fold higher than that of severe invasive isolates. Subcutaneous inoculation of NIH230scpC and NIH230slo yielded the local infected lesions with area comparable to those of 1566 and NIH230::csrS+ during the course of infection (Figure 7D). These results suggest that enhanced expression of ScpC and SLO in invasive GAS plays an important role in vivo virulence of GAS infection.
