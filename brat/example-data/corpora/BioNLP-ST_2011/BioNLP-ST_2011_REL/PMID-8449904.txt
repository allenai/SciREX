Transcriptional regulation of the pyruvate kinase erythroid-specific promoter. 
Mammal pyruvate kinases are encoded by two genes. The L gene produces the erythroid (R-PK) or the hepatic (L-PK) isozymes by the alternative use of two promoters. We report the characterization of the cis- and trans-acting elements involved in the tissue-specific activity of the L gene erythroid promoter. A R-PK DNA fragment extending from -870 to +54 relative to the cap site confers erythroid specificity to a reporter gene. Within this region, we define a minimal promoter (-62 to +54) that displays erythroid-specific activity and contains two DNA binding sites. One, located at -50, binds members of the CCACC/Sp1 family and the other, located at -20, binds the erythroid factor GATA-1. Although the -20 GATA binding site (AGATAA) is also a potential TFIID binding site, it does not bind TFIID. Furthermore, the substitution of this GATA binding site by a canonical TFIID binding site suppresses the promoter activity. Mutations and deletions of both sites indicate that only the association of CCACC/Sp1 and GATA binding sites can drive efficient and tissue-specific expression of this R-PK minimal promoter. Finally, by co-transfection experiments, we study the elements involved in the hGATA-1 transactivation of the R-PK promoter in HeLa cells.
