RP1, a new member of the adenomatous polyposis coli-binding EB1-like gene family, is differentially expressed in activated T cells. 
Cross-linking of the CD3 and CD28 molecules on T lymphocytes represents one of the most effective signals for T lymphocyte activation and triggering of their cytotoxic effector function. To identify genes that are expressed in T cells after stimulation, mRNA from T lymphocytes that had been activated by the simultaneous stimulation of the CD3 and CD28 trigger molecules was transcribed for a differential mRNA display analysis into cDNA and was compared with cDNA from CD28- or CD3-activated or resting lymphocytes. Differential expression was confirmed subsequently by Northern blot analysis. One of the cDNA fragments expressed specifically in CD3- and CD28-activated T cells was designated RP1. The predictive protein-coding region of RP1 had a significant homology to members of the recently found adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein-binding EB1 gene family, which codes for yet unknown protein(s). Bacterially expressed RP1 protein revealed specific binding to wild-type but not to mutated APC protein. The rapid up-regulation of RP1 mRNA in properly activated T cells suggests that this gene might belong to the immediate/early gene family, which controls the signal transduction cascade downstream of the TCR. As the expression level of the RP1 gene in activated T cells and a spectrum of tumor-derived cell lines correlates with the proliferative status of the cells, members of the EB1-like gene family may not only be involved in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancers but may also play a role in the proliferative control of normal cells.
