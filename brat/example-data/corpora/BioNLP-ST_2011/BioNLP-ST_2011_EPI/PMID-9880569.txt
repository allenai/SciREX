Enzymatic characteristics of recombinant medium isozyme of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase. 
P69 is an isozyme of the medium size class of human 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetases. In this study, recombinant P69 was expressed and used for enzymological and structural investigations. Bacterially expressed P69 was inactive whereas the same protein expressed in insect cells was highly active. Whether this difference could be due to differential post-translational modifications of the protein was investigated. Mutations of appropriate residues showed that myristoylation of the protein was not necessary for enzyme activity. In contrast, inhibition of glycosylation of P69, by tunicamycin treatment of the insect cells, produced an enzymatically inactive protein. Recombinant P69 produced in insect cells was purified by affinity chromatography. It was a dimeric glycoprotein, very stable and completely dependent on double stranded (ds) RNA for activity. The enzyme catalyzed the non-processive synthesis of 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylate products containing up to 30 residues. 2'-O-Methylated dsRNA was incapable of activating P69 and a 25-base pair dsRNA was as effective as larger dsRNA. This expression system will be useful for large scale production of P69 and its mutants for structural studies.
