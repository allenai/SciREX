A strategy of tRNA recognition that includes determinants of RNA structure. 
Recognition of tRNAs by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases establishes the connection between amino acids and anticodon triplets of the genetic code. Although anticodons and nucleotides adjacent to the amino acid attachment site are generally important, the tertiary structural framework of tRNAs has recently been implicated to have a role in tRNA recognition. A G15:G48 tertiary hydrogen base pair of E. coli tRNA(Cys) is important for recognition of the tRNA by cysteine tRNA synthetase. This base pair is proposed to consist of N2:N3, rather than N1:O6, hydrogen bonds. The reproduction of the hydrogen pairing scheme of tRNA(Gly). This reproduction required an A13:A22 mismatch in the dihyrouridine stem. To determine if A13:A22 is a determinant of the structural features of G15:G48, we investigated the A15:U48 and A15:A48 variants of tRNA(Gly) which harbored specific substitutions of A13:A22. We show here that introduction of A13:A22 to both tRNA frameworks confers structural features similar to those of G15:G48 in E. coli tRNA(Cys). These structural features are accompanied by efficient recognition of both tRNAs by cysteine tRNA synthetase. Substitution of A13:A22 with U13:A22 alters the structural features at 15:48 and impairs tRNA recognition. The dependence on A13:22 for tRNA recognition has a distinct similarity to that of E. coli tRNA(Cys) and to that of the G15:G48 variant of tRNA(Gly). The results have implications for the design and manipulation of RNA structural elements as the basis for tRNA recognition.
